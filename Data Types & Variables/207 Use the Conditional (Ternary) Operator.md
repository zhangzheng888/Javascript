The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is `a ? b : c`, where `a` is the condition, `b` is the code to run when the condition returns `true`, and `c` is the code to run when the condition returns `false`.

The following function uses an `if/else` statement to check a condition:

```
function findGreater(a, b) {
  if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater or equal";
  }
}
```

This can be re-written using the conditional operator:

```
function findGreater(a, b) {
  return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
}
```
