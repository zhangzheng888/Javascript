`Objects` are similar to `arrays`, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called `properties`.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

```
const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```

In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as `name`, `legs`, and `tails`. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

```
const exampleObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
```

However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
