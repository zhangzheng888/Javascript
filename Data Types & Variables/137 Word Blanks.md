You are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

Consider this sentence:

It is really ____, and they ____ themselves ____.

This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

```
const sentence = "It is really " + "cold" + ", and they " + "warmed" + " themselves " + "silly" + ".";
```
