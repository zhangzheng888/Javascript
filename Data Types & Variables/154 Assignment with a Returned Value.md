Everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

There is a defined function `sum` which adds two numbers together.

```
testSum = sum(5, 12);
```

Calling the `sum` function with the arguments of `5` and `12` produces a return value of `17`. This return value is assigned to the `testSum` variable.
