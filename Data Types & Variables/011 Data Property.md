`value`
The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value.

`writable`
A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment.

`enumerable`
A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a `for...in` loop. See also Enumerability and ownership of properties for how enumerability interacts with other functions and syntaxes.

`configurable`
A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to an accessor property, and can have its attributes changed.
