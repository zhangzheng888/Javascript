Order is important in `if`, `else if` statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:
```
function testFunc1(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```
And the second just switches the order of the statements:

```
function testFunc2(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```

While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

`testFunc1(0)`
`testFunc2(0)`

`testFunc1(0)` will return the string `Less than one`, and `testFunc2(0)` will return the string `Less than two`.
