/*
The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.
*/

let dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  numLegs: 4
};

console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
