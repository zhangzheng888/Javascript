In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `const myName = "Kevin"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

Example:

```
const firstName = "Kevin";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
```

`lastLetter` would have a value of the string `a`.
