The logical or operator (`||`) returns true if either of the operands is `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (`||`). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints.

```
if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
```
This code will return Yes if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written with the logical or operator.

```
if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
```
