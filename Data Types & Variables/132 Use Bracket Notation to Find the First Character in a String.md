Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Kevin is K. So if `const firstName = "Kevin"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using `firstName[0]`.

Example:
```
const firstName = "Kevin";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
```

`firstLetter` would have a value of the string `K`.
