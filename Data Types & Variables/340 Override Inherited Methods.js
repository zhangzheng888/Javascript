/*
In previous lessons, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by 
referencing its prototype object:
*/

ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

/*
Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:
*/

// ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...};

/*
It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype 
using the same method name as the one to override. Here's an example of Bird overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:
*/

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};
