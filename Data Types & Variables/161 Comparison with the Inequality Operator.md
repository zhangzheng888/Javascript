The inequality operator (`!=`) is the opposite of the equality operator. Inequality means not equal. The inequality operator returns `false` when the equality operator would return `true` and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

```
1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false
```
