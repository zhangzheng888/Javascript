# Data Types

There are different data types in JavaScript. It’s important to understand what type of data you’re dealing with as you’re writing code, and knowing the types of data are available to you is the first step.

Javascript has seven primitive data types:

`Boolean`
`undefined`
`null`
`Number`
`String`
`Symbol`
`BigInt`


Pro Tip: Remember these with the acronym BUNNSS (just ignore BigInt for now)
